<h2>A Live JavaScript Specification</h2>
<p>
JavaScript is the de facto programming language of the Web. Not only is it widely 
used for client-side programming [1], but it is also used for programming server-side 
applications via Node.js and it even runs on small embedded devices. 
</p>

<p>
To guarantee that JavaScript programs behave consistently across all platforms, the 
major browser vendors very early agreed to standardise the language, creating the 
ECMAScript standard [2]. The ECMAScript standard, currently in its 10th edition, 
is a long, complex document, written in English, which describes the syntax and 
semantics of JavaScript. It is written as if it were the pseudo-code of a JavaScript 
interpreter in that it describes each statement of the language operationally, 
detailing each step of the evaluation. 
</p>

<p> 
All the major JavaScript stakeholders (browser vendors, web security companies, 
governmental agencies, international research groups, etc) accept the ECMAScript standard
 to be the canonical version of the language and try to conform to it as closely as 
 possible in their own implementations and models. This makes the ECMAScript standard 
 one of the cornerstones of the internet of today. Despite its importance, the ECMAScript 
 standard is in constant change. In fact, the ECMA Committee holds various meetings during 
 the year to discuss modifications and additions to the standard in response to requests 
 from the JavaScript community. These modifications and additions must then be propagated 
 to the implementations of the language, which is often highly non-trivial as these 
 implementations rely on various optimisation strategies in order to be as performant 
 as possible [3,4]. 
</p> 

<p>
The <em>goal</em> of this project is to design and implement a mechanism to 
semi-automatically generate an executable version of the standard, the Live 
JavaScript Specification, from its official textual description. The Live JavaScript 
Specification will be primarily used as an oracle to test other implementations of the 
language, thereby contributing to the effort of making JavaScript run uniformly and 
correctly across all platforms. Further applications can also be envisaged; for instance, 
one could use the Live JavaScript Specification as a stepping stone for automatically 
synthesising a correct-by-construction JavaScript compiler [5] or an official language 
test-suite. 
</p> 

<p>
This project will consist of three main tasks. First, the student will design and 
implement ECMA-SL, a domain-specific language [6] for specifying and running the
 ECMAScript standard. Then, the student will apply rule-based natural language processing 
 techniques to (semi)-automatically obtain a JavaScript interpreter written in ECMA-SL 
 from the textual description of the standard. Lastly, the student will test the obtained 
 interpreter against Test262, the official JavaScript test suite.
